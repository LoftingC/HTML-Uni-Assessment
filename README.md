# HTML-Uni-Assessment

The HTML, CSS and PHP work was completed by me in my second year of University. 
The brief was to create a e-commerce site which would use php scripts to interact with the database on which information about each item would be listed. 

This example does not currently work as there is no database for the php scripts to interact with.
However, this is a display of my very first look into how HTML, CSS and PHP come together to create and interactive experience.
